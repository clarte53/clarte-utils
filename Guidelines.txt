This repository contains shared utility code. It only defines independent and
reusable class / modules intended to be used in many projects.

The guidelines for the authorized code are the following:
- Classes, static or extension methods.
- Components with no licence / copyright / confidentiality issues. Everything must be usable in every project.
- Independent components. They should not depend on anyting else, except if
  those dependencies are also included.
- Only 'utility' functions, i.e. which are used often and are rarely modified.
- Commented code. In particular, each public class or method must have
  comments following the C# XML conventions :
